# Calendar Event Scheduler

This project is a simple event scheduler built using JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap. The system allows users to add new events to their calendar by selecting a date and inputting a description. It displays the list of scheduled events and includes a dynamic filter for the next seven days. The events are also persisted in localStorage so that they remain even after the browser is refreshed.

- **Persist Data with LocalStorage**: The events are saved in localStorage to persist across browser refreshes.
